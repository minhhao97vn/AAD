# Defending Evasion Attacks via Adversarially Adaptive Training
Submission to Big Data 2022

This code replicates the experiments for defense baselines in the paper "Defending Evasion Attacks via Adversarially AdaptiveTraining"

Note: This code is built using implementation from IBM Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox) and the paper "Fast is better than free: Revisiting adversarial training
" (https://github.com/locuslab/fast_adversarial/). Please follow the instructions from above references for dependencies, documentation, and running the code.

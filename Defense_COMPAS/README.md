# Defending Evasion Attacks via Adversarially Adaptive Training
Submission to Big Data 2022

This code replicates the experiments for defense baselines in the paper "Defending Evasion Attacks via Adversarially AdaptiveTraining"

Note: This code is built using implementation from IBM Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox). Please follow the instructions from above reference for dependencies and documentation.

To run a defense, for example Defensive Distillation defense, please run `python defensive_distillation.py`
